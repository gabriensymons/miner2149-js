  [X] Does it prompt me to save name every time? Yes.
  [X] Does it remember the save slot name in the input? No.
    [X] But it would be cool to have. Added it!

  [X] If you can't afford a structure the store text is highlighted
[X] Add Undo system
  [X] Test it out on Emulator
  [X] See if I can see what it does in the code
  [X] Is there a way to indicate that there are no more undo's?

  [X] Keep track of most recent action to undo
  [X] Make sure undo works: It only undoes the last action
[X] Starting a new mine when there's a saved game in the auto save spot triggers a message:
  [X] Message: "Starting a new mining colony will overwrite an active mining colony. Do you wish to proceed?"
  [X] When you resign a colony does the save spot erase too? or just the autosave? Just the autosave.
[X] Is autosave working if you advance days?
[X] Exapnd hitzone for options menu
[X] Read manual
  - Notable info:
  - Power Plants can explode
  - Crash landings can happen at Space Ports
  - Important information is highlighted on reports.
  - The storage container will fill up as your storage space is used
  - After 20 days, you better have life support, power, hydoponics, and a sickbay in place.
  - An average wage is about 600-700 credits per day, but this will change depending on the selling price of diridium. (The workers aren't stupid.)
  - The simulation will end if you run out of credits, your 2 year term is completed, you are ousted for low morale, or the colony death rate approaches 100%. If you run out of credits, your creditors might extend you additional credit with the hope of recovering their losses. However, this is less likely to happen on more difficult asteroids.
[X] Too few ore veins on easy. There should be a minimum of 5, so 6 - difficulty

      [X] Should I create a message queue? For example, if there are multiple messages? Yes, though I don't know if we'll need it.

[X] Increase / lower wage
[X] Add creditors system - see line 2608
[X] Add C construction sprite tile
[X] Make it so clicking and holding over button then moving pointer off, then back on, doesn't result in a click.
  [X] BUG: Click and hold on "New Mine" then release over "Load Mine" opens load mine screen
[X] When loading, make sure the saved game names appear
[X] On load populate the save data state, for example: day number should match the saved day number
[X] Add random events    - see line 2498

[ ] Add grid sprite tiles
[ ] Add Disasters        - see line 2325
[ ] Add laser defense mini-game - figure out how to see it working in the emulator
[X] Does the game end at 2 years? Yes
  [ ] See EndGame() at line 1987
  [ ] And see CheckEvent() at line 2600 for the different events that end the game
[ ] How to calculate score?
  [ ] See line 2015 for end of game logic, hiscore is calculated on line 2036, it is the player's current credits
  [ ] Idea: Maybe make difficulty a multiplier?
[ ] Allow user to enter a name for their Hi Score
  [ ] Add Hi Score text to startScreen, launchScreen, gameOver screen
[ ] Make map animation bar smooth


== Font ==
[X] Bold letter M could use a thicker 2nd post
[X] Bold period is strangely wide
[ ] Capital W doesn't match
[ ] The "y" in Symons doesn't match the "y" in "lovingly"
  - (Maybe not a bug: It could be a graphical blip from overlapping layers)


== Bugs ==
[ ] Selling Diridium: "Sold for NaN credits"


== Buttons ==
[ ] Change button color on mouse down for every button, even menu icons
[ ] Replace hitzone buttons with text buttons
  [ ] Remove blue background on hitzones


== Questions ==
[X] What is "crdflg" on line 2611
  - it starts out at zero on line 1111
  - checked for `if (crdflg<(6-diff)){` on line 2611
  - then increments when the first credits warning appears line 2615
  - Answer: it's used to show the "out of credits" warning six times before it triggers a game-ending event
[ ] What is AniDisaster on line 149?


== UI / UX ==
[ ] Return / Escape key closes windows
  [ ]  Escape key closes the Load Mine window
[ ] On mobile when naming a save game slot, show keyboard
[ ] UX options to change backround color of game screen:
  [ ] Black & White
  [ ] Palm pilot green
  [ ] Glow-in-the-dark palm pilot green
  [ ] Gameboy green
  [ ] Dark mode
[ ] Dark mode designs for website


== Website ==
[X] Create a hosting website: miner2149.com
[ ] Mobile-first design for site
  - Design could use the game UI, buttons, and fonts
[ ] Auto-resize the game to full screen on mobile
  [ ] Add utility that detects mobile device
[ ] Include dark mode version
[ ] Add the game manual to site
[ ] Add Leaderboard
  [ ] Leaderboard for each difficulty level
  [ ] Inverse leaderboard for fastest to lose?
[ ] Datastuff
    [ ] Remove local storage stuff


== Account Creation & Login ==
[ ] Proper create account / login dialog
[ ] Look into Supabase policies - the policy setting wasn't working
[ ] Social login with oauth2
[ ] Idea: We could save different game states under the same account
    That means the login would be for a "parent" account


== Possible Ideas ==
[ ] Consider refactoring buildingMap numbers to match original code to make debugging easier
  - For example, 6-17 could be reduced by 1, and Mother Ship could be 17
[ ] It would be cool to have a dev mode, where you can view and debug the game data
